# LEBWeatherFix
A temporary patch mod for [LethalElementsBeta](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/v0xx/LethalElementsBeta/). This mod's primary purpose is to get the Toxic Smog weather working again, though it should also patch something in the Snowfall weather that happens during Christmas as it had the same underlying problem.
